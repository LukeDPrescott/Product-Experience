# Product-Experience

Hi, I'm Luke,
A product expert with 6+ years in SaaS technical solutions and projects. Below you will find information on a project I worked on while attending Product School. In this project, we had been provided a product and scenario. In this scenario, we had to demonstrate product improvement recommendations based on a data sheet we were provided. In this example, we designed customer notification features and a roadmap for developing a podcast hosting platform for content creators and end users.

Used to calculate return on investment (ROI), internal rate of return (IRR), net present value (NPV), cash flows, monthly recurring revenue (MRR) and total contract value (TCV) in order to gauge value of product enhancement, and determine if the product enhancement makes sense with business objectives.
